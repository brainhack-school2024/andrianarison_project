Computer Science MSc student at University of Montreal. Completed my BSc in neuroscience and I am interested in using machine learning working with neuroscience data. 

## Project definition
### Main Question
E.g., Can you combine tractography, fMRI and machine learning to improve schizophrenia diagnosis predictions?

### Background
* Theoretical background, previous works and literature
* Give some context for what has previously been done in this field.
* Keep it very short!

### Objectives
What do you want to achieve with this project? What are your goals?
Some examples:
* Learn a new technique
* Become familiar with a new data modality
* I'm just here for the credits and the AC!


## Methodology
How are you going to do the thing?
### Dataset
* Data modality (fMRI, dMRI, EEG, speech recordings, clinical / behavioural data, etc.)
* What dataset will you use (open dataset? your own lab's dataset?)

### Tools
* Preprocessing pipeline(s)
* Softwares, libraries
* Code and project management
* Statistical analyses

## Deliverables
* A Github repository with documented code to reproduce your analyses and results.
Other potential deliverables:
* A new dataset
* A jupyter notebook of the analysis codes and visualisations to display the results.
* Etc.

## Colaborators

## ADHD diagnosis prediction using machine learning classification models 

## Project definition
### Main Question
Can the integration of fMRI data and machine learning techniques make diagnosis predictions for ADHD?

### Background
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily functioning and development. The use of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has become increasingly valuable in understanding the neural correlates of ADHD and exploring potential diagnostic markers. Machine learning techniques have been applied to analyze fMRI data for diagnosing ADHD and predicting treatment outcomes. Classification models can leverage fMRI features to distinguish between individuals with ADHD and healthy controls, as well as to predict clinical outcomes or treatment responses. This project uses machine learning techniques to train models to make prediction of ADHD diagnosis. 

### Objectives
* Become more familiar with classification machine learning models and working with Scikit Learn
* Become more familiar with fMRI and how to work with fMRI data (preprocessing, visualization, connectivity analysis)
* Develop good project management practices

## Methodology
### Dataset
The data used in this project is the Nitrc ADHD resting-state dataset. The preprocessed data is available on Nilearn for 40 participants. 

### Tools
* Git and GitHub for version control
* fMRI data visualization, connectivity analysis with Nilearn
* plotly.express and ipywidgets to create interactive visualizations
* Machine learning with scikit learn with Python
* Jupyter notebook containing the code, and the visualization 

## Deliverables
* A Github repository for the project
* Jupyter notebook containing the code, visualizations, performances analysis and comparisons
