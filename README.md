Computer Science MSc student at University of Montreal. Completed my BSc in neuroscience and I am interested in using machine learning working with neuroscience data. 

## A


## Project definition
### Main Question
E.g., Can you combine tractography, fMRI and machine learning to improve schizophrenia diagnosis predictions?

### Background
* Theoretical background, previous works and literature
* Give some context for what has previously been done in this field.
* Keep it very short!

### Objectives
What do you want to achieve with this project? What are your goals?
Some examples:
* Learn a new technique
* Become familiar with a new data modality
* I'm just here for the credits and the AC!


## Methodology
How are you going to do the thing?
### Dataset
* Data modality (fMRI, dMRI, EEG, speech recordings, clinical / behavioural data, etc.)
* What dataset will you use (open dataset? your own lab's dataset?)

### Tools
* Preprocessing pipeline(s)
* Softwares, libraries
* Code and project management
* Statistical analyses

## Deliverables
* A Github repository with documented code to reproduce your analyses and results.
Other potential deliverables:
* A new dataset
* A jupyter notebook of the analysis codes and visualisations to display the results.
* Etc.

## Colaborators
* Name your friends, colleagues and frenemies here.
